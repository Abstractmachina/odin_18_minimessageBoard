# Odin Mini Message Board

This is a little app developed in express and deployed on fly.io following the Odin Project. It allows simple messages to be posted which are saved in a js array. 

I also took it as a good opportunity to learn the basics of Handlebars for the templating engine. After comparing it with the built-in engine Pug/Jade and ESJ, it seems more suitable as (a) I don't have to learn a completely new syntax (pug) and (b) the escape brackets are much cleaner to read than ESJ (in my opinion).
